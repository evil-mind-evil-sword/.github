## The Tools

**[Bicky](https://github.com/evil-mind-evil-sword/bicky)** — A programmable context editor. Concurrent, browser-native, GPU accelerated, completely open source.

## The Philosophy

We build tools that cut both ways. Dense interfaces for dense minds. Everything exposed, nothing hidden.

Against:
- Minimalism as laziness
- Interfaces that infantilize  
- Walled gardens
- Artificial scarcity
- The sanitized future

For:
- Performance as design
- Complexity without apology
- Tools that show their work
- Respecting user intelligence
- The hacker ethos

All tools open source. All tools free. Always.
