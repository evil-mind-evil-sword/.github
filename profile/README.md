This organization holds open-source tools made by _tool users_. 
We liberally make use of AI agents, but we trust in our expertise in software to curate the work these agents perform.
This organization is not a business, although businesses are free to use our tools.

## The Philosophy

Against:
- Minimalism as laziness
- Interfaces that infantilize  
- Walled gardens
- Artificial scarcity
- A sanitized future

For:
- Performance as design
- Complexity without apology
- Tools that show their work
- Respecting user intelligence
- The hacker ethos

Open-source, free, yours -- forever.
