# Evil mind, evil sword.

## The Tools

**[Bicky](https://github.com/evil-mind-evil-sword/bicky)** — An agentic editor that respects your intelligence. Terminal-native. Always free. Shows its guts.

## The Philosophy

We build tools that cut both ways. Dense interfaces for dense minds. Everything exposed, nothing hidden.

Against:
- Minimalism as laziness
- Interfaces that infantilize  
- Walled gardens
- Artificial scarcity
- The sanitized future

For:
- Performance as design
- Complexity without apology
- Tools that show their work
- Respecting user intelligence
- The hacker ethos

All tools open source. All tools free. Always.
