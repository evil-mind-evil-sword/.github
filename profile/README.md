## The Tools

**[Bicky](https://github.com/evil-mind-evil-sword/bicky)** — An agentic editor that respects your intelligence. Terminal-native. Always free. Shows its guts.

## The Philosophy

We build tools that cut both ways. Dense interfaces for dense minds. Everything exposed, nothing hidden.

Against:
- Minimalism as laziness
- Interfaces that infantilize  
- Walled gardens
- Artificial scarcity
- The sanitized future

For:
- Performance as design
- Complexity without apology
- Tools that show their work
- Respecting user intelligence
- The hacker ethos

## The Code

```
Every pointer leads to NULL.
Every function returns void.
The terminal sees all.
Fear the old code.
```

## Join Us

We're building elegant weapons for a civilized age. The kind of civilization where users compile from source and read the man pages.

All tools open source. All tools free. Always.
