This organization holds modular open-source AI tools made by _tool users_.
To develop our tools, we make liberal use of AI agents. We curate the work that these agents perform, using good software design principles and taste.

## The Philosophy

Against:
- Minimalism as laziness
- Interfaces that infantilize  
- Walled gardens
- Artificial scarcity
- A sanitized future

For:
- Performance as design
- Complexity without apology
- Tools that show their work
- Respecting user intelligence
- The hacker ethos
